        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These homemade waffle fries are crispy and beautifully on the outside, but perfectly soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Waffles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds russet potatoes</li>
            <li>Peanut or vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt or desired seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Zippy Fry Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dill pickle brine (from a jar of pickles)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce or bottled chipotle hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Waffles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (400 degrees C). Set two wire racks atop paper towels.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Using a mandoline with a waffle blade set to 1/4-inch, slice potatoes crosswise, then rotate 90Â° and make another slice for each waffle fry (you can also use a crinkle cutter using the same process).</li>
            <li>Add cut waffle fries to the ice water as they are done.</li>
            <li>In a large heavy saucepan, add 2 inches of oil. Clip a candy/oil thermometer to the side of the pan. Heat oil over medium heat to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Drain waffle fries and blot dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry waffle fries 4 to 5 minutes. They should just cook through at this point, but not brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and place on wire racks.</li>
            <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add waffle fries in batches and cook 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Transfer cooked fries to the oven to keep warm while frying remaining waffle fries.</li>
            <li>Serve with Zippy Fry Sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Zippy Fry Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, pickle brine, and Sriracha.</li>
        </ol>
